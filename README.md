# Home-Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Home Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for gaining hands-on experience using real-life tools that are used in pentesting and SOC analyst jobs. The primary focus is to gain familiarity with how these tools are used as well as to re-create scenarios in which they would come in useful. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of virtual machines and understanding of essential and basic cybersecurity tools used in the industry.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding how to set-up virtual machines
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark and NMAP) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
